# Techniques

### Focus based
*Keep coming back to it.*

### Shiva Sutras
1. Say *"Shiva"* with every cell of your body. To do this, engage every bone and every muscle of of your body when you chant "Shiva". A musical incantation  of the name is even more involving.
2. Say *"Shiva"* in an increasing pitch. Take a deep breath and chant "Shiva" but don't reduce the pitch like you do in chanting Om or any other mantra. 
	(The biggest hurdle for me was the feeling that someone would listen and wonder what is going on and that kept me from being with the chant)
3. Be aware of the subtle space between an inhalation and exhalation, and an exhalation and inhalation. Generally when we are 'focusing on the breath', we are actually focusing on the sensations created in the body as the result of the breathing. It's a different thing to be aware of the breath itself and yet another thing to be aware of the space between in and out breaths.
	* A way Sadhguru suggested to help getting into flow is to stand up and gently sway from side to side. After some time, the breath will come into sync with the sway and it becomes easy to immerse in the awareness.
