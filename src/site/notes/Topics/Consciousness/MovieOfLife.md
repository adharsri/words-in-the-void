# Movie of Life
*"Life is like a movie. A play. We are but characters in it."*"

You can watch movies hours and hours on end and realize that even though you travelled to many places, you have just been sitting in the same place. Similarly, this life is a movie you are seeing on your brain screen. Yes you can go to so many places and experieces so many things, but at the end, it's your body and brain that travels and experiences. Your mind has been in the same place.
Mind for me is a timeless construct. It exists only in the present. So no matter where you go, your mind is ever in the same place. 
But does it mean it's all pointless? Definitely not. When you are watching a movie, you suspend disbelief for a couple of hours and become invested in the movie and the characters and the story both emotionally and intellectually. Even though you know it's not real, it doesn't take away the enjoyment you experience during that time. The play of life runs a bit longer than that but it offers a lot more in terms of experiences. What's more is that you get to direct ***and*** play in it.
