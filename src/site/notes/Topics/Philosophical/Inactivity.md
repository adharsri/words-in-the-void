# Inactivity
A human being always has a set of self imposed goals. It can be anything from as small as reading a book to starting their own company. It's not wrong by any means. Without goals we can not move in any direction. While a goal can keep us motivated, sometimes we find ourselves not moving or willing to move in that direction and that can baffle us. It makes us lose confidence in ourselves and can cause all kinds of emotional and psychological reactions. 
At any given time we also have something we *really* want to do. Something that interests us and pulls us towards itself. When we have this push and pull between what we want to do and what we need to do, that is, the goal we had set earlier, which, incidentally is something we *wanted* to do earlier, we end up doing neither. We keep getting deeper and deeper into the quicksand of inactivity and self loathing. We waste time doing things that we neither want to do neither we need to do. We end up getting more and more detached from ourselves.
I believe we need to have a balance between doing what interests us and doing what needs to be done. One will help us do the other. Interests fulfill us and fill us with energy that we can use to do what needs to be done (that is not to say that our goals don't fulfill us, it's just that we forget that they do). When we do what needs to be done, it frees our mind to explore our interests. We need to realize this and enter this loop in some way.
It may also be possible that what we want to do is not actually possible ([Dexter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/) anyone?) or that what we need to do does not feel like a worthy goal. If this is the case, it's time to take a break. Travel, spend time with family and friends, read, explore yourself; do whatever expands your mind. These things have the power to bring clarity and purpose in life. 
This is all to say this: Life has no inherent meaning or purpose. It's what we define it to be that determines how well we spend our time.
