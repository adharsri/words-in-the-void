# Search for Meaning
When we read a poem, most of us try to find the poetry in the words. We forget, or don't even know, that the poetry is not just in the words, but also in the words that are not written; it's in the spaces between the words; it's in the pauses between the lines and the breaks between the stanzas.

We already know that poetry is highly subjective. Two people reading the same poem can have very different perspectives on it. But we forget this. We search for the meaning in the words but a poem does not have any meaning in itself. The meaning is inside of us. A poem, or any work of art, is a tool for us to recognize that meaning that is already in us.

Life is also like that, isn't it? We get hung up on words, other's words or our own. But that's not where meaning lies.

Words can only convey information. But the meaning is inside us.
