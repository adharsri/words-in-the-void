# The Elegant Universe
#### Quotes

#### Points
- Author states that it is a mystery why the subatomic particles are the way they are. Why do they have the exact mass and charge that they do? If they were just a bit different, the universe would have been completely different and most likely wouldn't exist at all. My thoughts: [[Topics/Books/The Elegant Universe#^b885b7 \| Survival is a universal instinct]]

#### My thoughts
##### Survival is a universal instinct
{ #b885b7}


- What if survival is not the basic instinct of living beings but even of even the smallest of particles and forms? What if during the big-bang (assuming it happened), an infinite types of particles with varying masses and charges were expelled and only those particles which proved to be the most stable, the ones that were the most 'sociable' with each other, survived. These are the particles that make up the universe today, namely, protons, electrons and neutrons and of course, their constituent quarks. 
- The very fact that so many newly discovered particles like muons and tau are ephemeral is indicative of why many other types of particles don't exist: they are simply not stable enough to sustain themselves and survive with other particles.
- So, the masses and charges of all the most familiar particles couldn't have been any different because that's what they have to be to survive and for us to be able to observe them.
- It's not luck it's just Darwinian.
