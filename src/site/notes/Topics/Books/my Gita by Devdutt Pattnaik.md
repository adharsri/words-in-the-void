#### Sholkas paraphrased
- Arjuna, to expand your mind, use intelligence to understand and detach from sensuality, so that there is no self-obsession, aggression, arrogance, desire, anger, possessiveness, attraction or repulsion. You are content in solitude, consuming little, expressing little, connected with the world and aware.
	  <font size="1">Paraphrased from Bhagavad Git: Chapter 18, verse 52 to 53</font>
	  <font size="1">Inspired from my Gita by Devdutt Pattnaik(Chapter 11, Para 2, Page 149)</font>

#### Quotes 
> Sometimes, you can see more than me, but you pretend to know less so that I don't feel intimidated by you. I do the same for you. We do not feel superior  when the other is vulnerable; or inferior when we feel helpless. This is what sustains a relationship
<font size="1"> my Gita by Devdutt Pattnaik(Chapter 12, Page 170)</font>

#### Points
* "I want you to need me. If you do not need me, and only give me, without taking anything from me, I feel inadequate, meaningless, valueless and purposeless. In wanting me, you illuminate me and contribute to my fulfillment. Likewise, you want me to need you. If I do not need you, if I am dependable but detached, you will feel insulted, hurt, unwanted, and I will appear patronizing."
  <font size="1">my Gita by Devdutt Pattnaik(Chapter 18, Page 234)</font>

#### Topics
##### Gunas
There are three 'gunas' or qualities of everything in the universe: 
 - Tamas - When tamas dominates, there is inertia. Tendency to stay as it is or follow a set of rules without questions. All elements have this quality.
 - Rajas - When Rajas dominates, there is a tendency to grow and eat and to survive. All plants and animals have this quality.
 - Sattva - When Sattva dominates, there is understanding, empathy and happiness. Humans have the capacity for this quality.
 
Of course humans are not Sattvik all the time. The three gunas are in a certain ratio in each human being.
Sometimes one quality is more dominant than the other two.

When a human has a Tamasik phase, there is laziness and confusion. Tamas stops us from thinking. This is when one blindly follows and does work that is purely material and physical in nature.

When in Rajasik phase, there is dynamism and hunger and passion. This is when one strives to achieve. In this phase, there is greed and restlessness and doubtfulness is at its peak. One trusts no one but oneself.

When Sattva is dominant, there is balance, empathy and understanding. One knows when to listen and when to speak. When to lead and when to follow. There is equanimity in mind and body. Balance of stillness and motion.

Tamas is dominant in children when they follow adults. Rajas is dominant in the fiercely independent and energetic youth. Sattva is dominant in the mature.
