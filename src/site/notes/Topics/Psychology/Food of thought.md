# Food of thought
Our mind feeds on thought. All it wants to eat is thought. What our mind dislikes the most is boredom. Boredom is nothing but lack of external stimuli to generate thought. Our mind would prefer to have good, interesting and exciting thoughts but if it doesn't get all those, it *will* settle on the unproductive and even harmful thoughts. That is what anxiety is. It consists of thoughts that generate fear about the future but our brain doesn't care. It has the food and that's all. 

So be careful what you feed your mind. If you realize that it's not a hopeless task to calm your mind down, you point it in a direction you want; that all it takes is a little effort to orient yourself in towards a desirable action or event to give your brain useful thoughts, the anxiety and unproductive thoughts will fade away.

Be aware of your thoughts and the tendencies of your brain. If you can do that, it can dilute the effect of the those anxiety inducing thoughts by itself.
