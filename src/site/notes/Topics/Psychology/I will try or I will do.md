# I will try or I will do?

When you say I will try, it just means that you think you may not be able to do it. When you say I will try,  it indicates that you think that doing something means success or failure. But that's not the case, is it? Whether you try to do something or you just do something, you will be taking the same steps of action. So you will be doing the same things. The only difference will be, when you say I will try, you will be confused, you will be afraid and you will be dejected. But you will still do it. But when you say I will do it, you will at most be a little concerned about the timelines and stuff. So don't try. Just do it.
