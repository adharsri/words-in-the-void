# Identity of a smart kid

If as a kid you have always been told that you are a smart kid, you start to develop an identity that you are smart. This leads to you to actions that reinforce that identity and away from situations where you might feel stupid.
 The problem is, most of the interesting and new stuff happens only when we allow ourselves to not be the smartest person. 
 Most people, when you ask them why they don't challenge themselves, will tell you it's because they are *"lazy"*
 What to do about it?
 Reframe your looking at yourself and the world from **intelligent-stupid** to **experienced-inexperienced**.
 Solution is simple, try to do things that you think have a chance where you might potentially have felt stupid. Take control.
