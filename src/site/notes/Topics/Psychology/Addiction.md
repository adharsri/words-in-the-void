# Addiction
We all know about the concept of reward and punishment. The way our brain functions is that if you reward any behavior, it will keep repeating that behavior. If you punish it, it won't. If you don't do anything, it may or may not repeat it.

When we are feeling sad or angry or any kind of upset, we seek comfort. This can be in the form of food, entertainment, neuro-stimulants, sex, etc. When we get any of this, we feel better. But why? Only because all we did is reward our brain for feeling that way. It's no better than the brain of a monkey or a dog or a child in that respect.

First time the thought or action happens, it just happens for no reason. If we keep rewarding it, it can become a habit. Then it becomes a mindset. Then it becomes a compulsion and finally, it becomes an addiction.

So if you don't want some type of thought or action to be perpetuated, don't reward it. 

But what if you are already addicted? 
When we get a craving to eat fast food of smoke, we first get a certain type of feeling in the body or a thought in the mind. This feeling or thought becomes hard to get rid of and we end up indulging it. So when we say we are addicted to something, say, food or cigarettes, we are not in reality addicted to those items themselves. We are addicted to the thought or feeling that comes before. These items are just a reward for our brain for thinking or feeling that way.
So next time you get a craving, try this: Notice the feeling or thought itself and realize that the craving for something is just your brain asking for a reward. Imagine it like an angry animal throwing a tantrum. If you can see that, just walk away and don't reward it.
