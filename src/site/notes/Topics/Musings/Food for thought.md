# Food for thought

* "You can not enter any world for which you have no language"

* We are all characters in the play of life.

* If you want to understand someone, don't judge them. If you want to understand yourself, don't judge yourself.
* Don't just live a functional life. Smile with your bones. Enjoy life.
* Intense focus and compassion. These two are the core qualities of a true spiritual seeker and should be for any human in general.
* The smaller we see our world to be, the more seriously we start taking it. For better or for worse.
* Comfort comes not from the experiences you enjoy but the fears that you avoid.
* Your attention naturally flows in the direction of whatever you think is important. None of it is important; or everything is.
* Wisdom is the state of being when you are able to follow your own advice.
* You can never truly predict the future. No matter what choice you make, there will always be joys and there will always be regrets. So just take that next step and see where it leads you.
* You can not get stability by relying on things that are moving/variable in your life. Moving factors give movement which is good as it makes our lives rich and interesting. If you want stability, you need to rely on the unchanging factors. Of which there is only one - the nature of your mind.
* If you define height by Mount Everest then even Kailash will seem insignificant.
* You don't need to know everything. What you need is the humility to accept that you don't know and the curiosity to know everything.
* Don't be in a hurry to relax.
* Thoughts are nothing but abbreviated understandings.
* Stress can forge coal into diamond. It can also crush it into dust. Good thing humans are capable of understanding and managing their stress. Hopefully.
* Words can only convey information, they cannot convey meaning.  See also: [[Topics/Philosophical/Search for Meaning\|Search for Meaning]]
