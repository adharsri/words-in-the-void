# What is your purpose in life?

Every living being on Earth has just one purpose: to be born, live their life, reproduce and eventually die. But human beings are different somehow. However, humans are unique in that sense. We're not content with just this simple cycle. Instead, we yearn for something more profound, something we might not fully understand ourselves. What we all seem to realize, though, is the importance of having a purpose in life, and that purpose can take countless forms. For some, it may be as simple as finding joy in life to the fullest. Others may seek purpose in exploring the world or delving into self-discovery. Some may dedicate themselves to artistic pursuits, such as learning and producing music, while others find their purpose in helping others or caring for the planet itself. The possibilities are limitless.

Is it essential for us to introspect and discover our individual purposes? After all, a life devoid of a meaningful pursuit can seem empty, leaving us with a sense of dissatisfaction, regrets, anger, stress, and anxiety. These feelings have their place, but should they dominate our lives until the very end?

It's important to distinguish between a purpose and a goal. A goal is something in the future, while purpose exists in the present. The pursuit is the purpose, and the purpose becomes our pursuit. We need to realize that the pursuit itself brings enjoyment. If we live as if we're dying everyday, are we really living? 

In the end, it's crucial to understand our purpose and wholeheartedly embrace it.
