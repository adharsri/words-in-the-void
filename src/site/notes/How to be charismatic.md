# How to be charismatic
* Do not divide your attention. Always focus on a single thing only.
* When you fix eyes with someone, choose one eye and stick to it when speaking. Don't change eyes.
* Speak slowly and clearly. No fast gibberish.
* When you make a decision, stand by it and take responsibility.
* Listen first and speak second
